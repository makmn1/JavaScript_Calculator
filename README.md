# JavaScript_Calculator
An HTML page taking in a mathematical expression given by the user, and then using JavaScript, calculates the result of that expression.

## Supports Live Typing
As the user types their expression, the calculator converts it to a valid mathematical expression.
There is still work to be done on how it converts negatives with parentheticals.

## Calculate multiple times
Every time the calculate button is pressed, an answer is generated. Answers are usually accurate or close.
Again, negatives and parentheses can make these calculations less accurate due to imperfect order of operations. This will be fixed in a later update.

## Supports 5 Operations
For addition, use the plus symbol: +
For subtraction, use the subtraction symbol: -
For multiplication, use the asterisk symbol: *
For division, use the foward slash symbol: /
For exponentiation, use the caret symbol: ^
